# Spring Boot "Microservice" E-Wallet

This is a Java / Maven / Spring Boot application that can be used as a starter for creating a microservice complete with built-in health check, metrics and much more.

## How to Run 

This application is packaged as a war which has Tomcat 8 embedded. No Tomcat or JBoss installation is necessary. You run it using the ```java -jar``` command.

* Clone this repository 
* Make sure you are using JDK 11 and Maven 
* You can build the project and run the tests by running ```mvn clean package```
* Once successfully built, you can run the service by one of these two methods:
```
        java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=test target/spring-boot-rest-example-0.5.0.war
or
        mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments="spring.profiles.active=test"
```
* Check the stdout or boot_example.log file to make sure no exceptions are thrown

Once the application runs you should see something like this

```
2017-08-29 17:31:23.091  INFO 19387 --- [           main] s.b.c.e.t.TomcatEmbeddedServletContainer : Tomcat started on port(s): 8090 (http)
2017-08-29 17:31:23.097  INFO 19387 --- [           main] com.khoubyari.example.Application        : Started Application in 22.285 seconds (JVM running for 23.032)
```

## About the Service

Payment Backend service Following Monolithic Architecture
And backed by Spring Boot and implemented industry level design patterns by making use of various spring specific microservices.

Here is what this little application demonstrates: 

* Full integration with the latest **Spring** Framework: inversion of control, dependency injection, etc.
* Packaging as a single war with embedded container (tomcat 8): No need to install a container separately on the host just run using the ``java -jar`` command
* Demonstrates how to set up healthcheck, metrics, info, environment, etc. endpoints automatically on a configured port. Inject your own health / metrics info with a few lines of code.
* Writing a RESTful service using annotation: supports both XML and JSON request / response; simply use desired ``Accept`` header in your request
* Exception mapping from application exceptions to the right HTTP response with exception details in the body
* *Spring Data* Integration with JPA/Hibernate with just a few lines of configuration and familiar annotations. 
* Automatic CRUD functionality against the data source using Spring *Repository* pattern
* Demonstrates MockMVC test framework with associated libraries
* All APIs are "self-documented" by Swagger2 using annotations 

Here are some endpoints you can call:

### API CALLS, etc.

```
http://localhost:8091/user
http://localhost:8091/user/{username}
http://localhost:8091/transaction
http://localhost:8091/transaction/{transaction_id}
http://localhost:8091/
```

### Create a user

```
/**
     *
     * json required param
     * {
     * 	"username":"neelesh67",
     * 	"password":"******",
     * 	"email":"rawatneelesh0@gmail.com"
     * }
     */

RESPONSE: HTTP 201 (Created)

```

### Retrieve a user

```
http://localhost:8091/user/neelesh67
Response: HTTP 200
Content: paginated user 
```

# About Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an "opinionated" application bootstrapping framework that makes it easy to create new RESTful services (among other types of applications). It provides many of the usual Spring facilities that can be configured easily usually without any XML. In addition to easy set up of Spring Controllers, Spring Data, etc. Spring Boot comes with the Actuator module that gives the application the following endpoints helpful in monitoring and operating the service:

**/metrics** Shows “metrics” information for the current application.

**/health** Shows application health information.

**/info** Displays arbitrary application info.

**/configprops** Displays a collated list of all @ConfigurationProperties.

**/mappings** Displays a collated list of all @RequestMapping paths.

**/beans** Displays a complete list of all the Spring Beans in your application.

**/env** Exposes properties from Spring’s ConfigurableEnvironment.

**/trace** Displays trace information (by default the last few HTTP requests).


# Running the project with MySQL

This project uses an in-memory database so that you don't have to install a database in order to run it. However, converting it to run with another relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL is very easy. Since the project uses Spring Data and the Repository pattern, it's even fairly easy to back the same service with MongoDB. 

Here is what you would do to back the services with MySQL, for example: 

### In pom.xml add: 

```
        <dependency>
            <groupId>mysql</groupId>
            <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
        </dependency>
```

### Append this to the end of application.yml: 

```
---
spring:
  profiles: mysql

  datasource:
    driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
    url: jdbc:mysql://<your_mysql_host_or_ip>/bootexample
    username: <your_mysql_username>
    password: <your_mysql_password>

  jpa:
    hibernate:
      dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLInnoDBDialect
      ddl-auto: update # todo: in non-dev environments, comment this out:


```

### Then run is using the 'mysql' profile:

```
        java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=mysql target/spring-boot-rest-example-0.5.0.war
or
        mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.jvmArguments="-Dspring.profiles.active=mysql"
```
